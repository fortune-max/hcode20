# Hashcode 2020
This year's problem is based on the Google Book's platform  

Essentially you're to try to maximize the total score of books scanned  

Libraries contain books, some of these which occur in more than one library  

Libraries also have a property which states how long it takes to get a library signed up before book scanning  

# Files
inputs/xxxx.txt => Question inputs  
outputs/xxxx.out => Solution outputs  
practice => Practice problem pizza slice  
lib_books.py => Solution program  
scores => scores obtained
